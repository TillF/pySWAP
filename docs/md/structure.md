# About

Python has become a go-to general purpouse programming language in science. As of the end of 2023, there has only been a SWAP wrapper written in R, which does not cater all potential users. Therefore, we develop pySWAP, a Python SWAP wrapper. pySWAP is based on object oriented programming approach where model parameters are stored as classes and manupulated by class methods and helper functions, making it more elegant, easier to understand and manipulate in more automated way.

In this documentation we present the structure of pySWAP module by module with use examples.
